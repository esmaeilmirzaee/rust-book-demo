1. Programming in a functional style often includes using functions as values by passing them in arguments, returning them from other functions, assigning them to variables for later execution, and so forth.
2. _Rust_’s closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions. You can create the closure in one place and then call the closure to evaluate it in a different context. Unlike functions, closures can capture values from the scope in which they’re defined.
3. We want to refer to `simulated_expensive_calculation` only once in `generate_workout`, but **defer the expensive calculation to only where we actually need the result**. _This is a use case for closures!_
